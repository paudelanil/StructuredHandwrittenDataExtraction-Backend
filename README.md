# 📝 Structured Handwritten Data Extraction Backend

This repository contains the backend for our final year project: **Structured Handwritten Data Extraction**. It is a FastAPI-based system that automatically extracts structured text—both printed and handwritten—from scanned documents such as marksheets, forms, and survey sheets using advanced OCR and layout analysis techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

Despite the shift to digital systems, handwritten documents are still widely used in sectors like healthcare, education, and finance. Manual data entry is time-consuming and error-prone. This system automates the process using:

- **DocLayout-YOLO** for layout detection  
- **YOLOv8** for word-level handwritten detection  
- **PaddleOCR** for printed text recognition  
- **TrOCR** for handwritten text recognition  
- **Table Transformer** for tabular data extraction

The pipeline ensures **layout-independent**, **accurate**, and **structured** output, ideal for digitization workflows.
